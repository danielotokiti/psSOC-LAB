## Day 4 â€“ Custom Detection Rules + Alert Output

### Tasks Completed
- Created a Wazuh rule to detect suspicious `powershell.exe` usage with Base64 encoding
- Tuned rules for `svchost.exe` to lower severity for common legitimate usage and reduce false positives
- Set up Slack integration for high-severity alerts
